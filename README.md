The project includes the layout and client-side logic for the following pages and components:

-   **Homepage (`home.html`):** a product catalog with interactive filters.
-   **Product Pages:** 12 unique pages for each product, complete with descriptions, specifications, and user reviews.
-   **Shopping Cart (`cart.html`):** an interactive cart with features to change item quantities and remove items, with automatic total recalculation.
-   **Checkout (`checkout.html`):** a form for entering shipping information and selecting a payment method.
-   **Authentication:**
    -   Login (`login.html`), registration (`register.html`), and password recovery (`forgot_password.html`) pages.
    -   **Login/Logout Simulation:** the header dynamically changes based on the user's authentication status (using `localStorage`).
-   **User Account (`account.html`):** a tabbed page for viewing order history and editing user information.
-   **Custom Admin Panel:**
    -   A page to view the product list (`admin/products.html`).
    -   A form to add/edit products (`admin/add.html`) with an image upload simulation.
